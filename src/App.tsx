Methodology: Actual distance is measured using mapping tools, then converted to a 1-10 scale where 1 is farthest and 10 is closest to the ocean.",
  
  schoolRank: "Represents the overall ranking of the school based on various factors such as academic reputation, faculty resources, and student outcomes. Methodology: Derived from published college rankings (e.g., U.S. News & World Report) and converted to a 1-10 scale. Higher values indicate better overall ranking.",
  
  anthropologyRank: "Indicates the strength of the school's Anthropology program. Methodology: Based on factors such as faculty expertise, research output, course offerings, and student outcomes specific to the Anthropology department. Converted to a 1-10 scale where higher values represent stronger programs.",
  
  housingAvailability: "Reflects the ease of finding student housing, both on and off-campus. Methodology: Calculated based on the ratio of available housing units to the student population, as well as the variety of housing options. Scored on a 1-10 scale where higher values indicate greater availability.",
  
  housingAffordability: "Measures how affordable student housing options are relative to the local cost of living and typical student budgets. Methodology: Considers average rent prices, cost of university housing, and local cost of living indices. Scored on a 1-10 scale where higher values indicate more affordable options.",
  
  walkabilityScore: "Assesses how easy it is to get around the campus and surrounding area on foot. Methodology: Based on factors such as pedestrian friendliness, proximity of amenities, and campus layout. Uses data from walkability indices and student surveys. Higher scores (1-10 scale) indicate better walkability.",
  
  publicTransport: "Evaluates the quality and availability of public transportation options near the college. Methodology: Considers factors such as frequency of service, variety of transport options (bus, train, etc.), and coverage area. Based on public transport data and student feedback. Higher scores on the 1-10 scale indicate better public transport systems.",
  
  employmentOpportunities: "Reflects the availability of part-time jobs, internships, and post-graduation employment prospects in the area. Methodology: Combines data on local job markets, college career services effectiveness, and alumni employment rates. Scored 1-10, with higher values indicating more abundant opportunities.",
  
  safety: "Assesses the overall safety of the college campus and surrounding area. Methodology: Based on crime statistics, campus security measures, and student surveys about perceived safety. Also considers factors like lighting, emergency response systems, and safety education programs. Scored on a 1-10 scale where higher values indicate safer environments."
